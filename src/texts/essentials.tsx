        The home page is designed to give users a comprehensive analysis of
        their daily activities. It displays the amount of time spent on
        productive activities versus non-productive ones. Additionally, it
        provides a detailed breakdown of the time spent on each visited website.
      </>,

        Freemium alerts, including Hourly and Daily summaries, are also featured
        on the home page. These summaries offer a brief yet insightful look into
        how users have spent their time over the last hour or day, combining
        creative narratives with precise data for an engaging overview.

        In the "Websites" section of the Configure page, users can view a list
        of all visited websites and see how they've been categorized:
        productive, non-productive, or unsure. "Unsure" websites are those not
        automatically tagged by our system and require manual categorization by
        the user. This can be done in the "Tag Websites" area.
