        Recenter provides users with alerts designed to enhance productivity and
        offer insightful summaries of their online activity. These alerts fall
        into two main categories:
        <ul>
          <li>Regular Alerts</li>
          <li>Freemium Alerts</li>
        </ul>
      </>,
      <>
        <div>
          <strong>Regular Alerts</strong>
        </div>
        Regular alerts generally indicated with Blue background serve multiple
        purposes:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Daily Greetings:</strong> Start your day with a motivational
            greeting from Recenter.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong> Productivity Reminders:</strong> Receive notifications when
            you're spending time on potentially distracting websites. These
            alerts are designed to nudge you back towards more productive
            activities. They occur proactively, without the need for specific
            triggers, embodying a preventative approach to maintaining focus.
          </li>
        </ul>
        Users have the option to temporarily dismiss alerts for certain
        websites. However, if ignored beyond a set duration, as defined in the
        user's settings, these sites may be automatically blocked to ensure
        productivity. For necessary but potentially distracting sites, users can
        either reclassify them as productive or set daily usage limits through
        the Configure panel.
